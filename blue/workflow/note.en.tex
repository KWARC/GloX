\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We describe the initial ideas for the \FAUstairs glossary extraction and curation
  process and the workflows and tooling we envision to supports it.

  This blue note is (supposed to be) a living document that describes the current state of
  the discussion, to serve as an implementation guide and initial documentation for the
  \GloX tool ecosystem.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

A Central part of the \FAUstairs project (``Formative Assessment for Universities:
Strategic Application of Innovative Methods to Raise Study Success Rates'' see
\url{https://faustairs.fau.de}) is the development and curation of a \defemph{domain
  model} -- i.e. a set of key concepts and their definitions -- for large portions of the
courses at FAU (and the development of added-value services on top of that to establish
formative assessment).

In the following we describe the information sources, the glossary extraction and curation
workflows and the GloX tool ecosystem.

\section{Information Sources and Stakeholders}\label{sec:sources}

The main sources of information for the \FAUstairs domain model are the
following\ednote{MK: I am sure there are more, need to extend}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the module descriptions in \campo: \url{https://campo.fau.de}
\item the course infrastructure and curriculum data on \studon: \url{https://studon.fau.de}
\item the course materials of the instructors. 
\end{enumerate}
The first two are avaialable via the \DIP system, a centralized infrastructure and data
store for synchronization of the FAU learning administration systems provided by the FAU
RRZE.

The stakeholders in the \GloX process are\ednote{MK: there must be more; extend}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \defemph{degree programs} represented by the program directors (the faculty
  member formally in charge), the program coordinators and maybe the study advisors.
\item The \defemph{departments} that host the degree programs, represented by their
  speakers and the department manager.
\item The instructors of the mandatory courses of a degree program; here we include the
  persons who organize the tutorials, homeworks, and (summative) assessments. 
\end{enumerate}
